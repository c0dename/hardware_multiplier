Fast hardware multiplier
The aim was to minimise hardware utilization maximise speed of operation. With these constraints, the Batcher’s Odd-Even Merge Sort algorithm was selected.
Batcher’s oddeven mergesort is a generic construction devised by Ken Batcher for sorting networks of size O(n(logn)2) and depth O((logn)2), where n is the number of items to be sorted. Although it is not asymptotically optimal, Knuth concluded in 1998, with respect to the AKS network that ”Batcher’s method is much better, unless n exceeds the total memory capacity of all computers on earth!”
